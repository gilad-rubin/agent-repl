# agent-repl

**Multiplayer Jupyter notebooks — AI agents and humans collaborate in real time.**

The notebook open in VS Code/Cursor is the human-facing surface. The CLI is the agent-facing surface. Both share the same kernel, the same file, and the same state.

## How It Works

A VS Code extension runs an HTTP bridge server. The CLI talks to it. The extension handles notebook reads and edits through VS Code's notebook API, and executes cells either through a background Jupyter session (`no-yank`) or VS Code's native notebook command path (`native`).

```
Human (VS Code / Cursor)
    ↕
VS Code Extension (bridge server)
    ↕  HTTP / JSON
Agent (CLI)
```

The extension auto-starts when VS Code finishes loading the workspace and writes a connection file so the CLI can discover it.
The CLI now requires a workspace match instead of silently falling back to a different window's bridge.
By default, the bridge only operates on notebooks inside its own workspace; it will reject external notebook paths instead of opening them in that window.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
uv tool install /path/to/agent-repl

# Create a notebook and start working
agent-repl new analysis.ipynb
agent-repl ix analysis.ipynb -s 'import pandas as pd; print(pd.__version__)'
agent-repl cat analysis.ipynb
```

The `ix` command (insert-execute) adds a cell to the notebook and runs it. The cell appears in VS Code immediately — a human watching sees it show up with its output.

Agent-triggered execution defaults to `no-yank`, which prefers the background Jupyter path so the notebook can keep updating without stealing editor focus. If you want the original VS Code behavior, set `agent-repl.executionMode` to `native`.

Creating a brand-new notebook still goes through Jupyter kernel attachment, so the first create/select-kernel step may briefly reveal the notebook. `agent-repl new` and `agent-repl select-kernel` now prefer the workspace `.venv` automatically when it exists, and the JSON response says which kernel was selected. Use `agent-repl select-kernel ... --interactive` when you want the VS Code kernel picker explicitly. Once the kernel is already attached, `exec` and `ix` can usually stay on the no-yank path.

## Key Features

- **Live kernel access** — Execute code, read outputs, inspect state against a running Jupyter kernel from the CLI
- **Notebook-as-conversation** — Humans create prompt cells in VS Code, agents discover and respond via CLI
- **Fire-and-forget execution** — `ix` returns immediately with a `cell_id`; execution continues in the background
- **Smart output filtering** — Rich media (HTML, images, widgets) stripped for agents; notebook file keeps everything for humans
- **Stable cell IDs** — UUID-based cell identity survives moves, deletes, and reordering
- **Hot-reload** — Update extension routes without restarting the bridge
- **Experimental v2 core daemon** — Start a workspace-scoped core authority process with attach/resume session flows, collaboration branches, document, runtime, run, and file-sync registration independent of VS Code, with workspace-owned state persistence across daemon restarts
- **VS Code v2 projection attach** — The extension now auto-attaches the editor window to the matching v2 core session when the bridge starts, so editor presence becomes part of the shared runtime contract
- **Deterministic v2 launcher discovery** — Auto-attach now prefers an explicit CLI path and workspace-local `.venv` launchers before falling back to PATH-based resolution
- **Explicit file sync boundaries** — Registered v2 documents track bound file snapshots, detect external changes, and require explicit rebinding instead of silently accepting disk drift

## The Prompt Loop

The notebook becomes a bidirectional conversation channel.

**Human clicks "Ask Agent" in VS Code toolbar**, creating a prompt cell.

**Agent discovers and responds:**
```bash
agent-repl prompts demo.ipynb
agent-repl respond demo.ipynb --to <cell_id> -s 'df.dropna(inplace=True)'
```

The `respond` command atomically: marks the prompt in-progress → inserts a response cell → executes it → marks the prompt answered.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cat` | Read notebook contents (cleaned for agents) |
| `status` | Kernel state + running/queued cells |
| `exec` | Execute a cell by `--cell-id` or inline code |
| `ix` | Insert cell + execute (fire-and-forget) |
| `edit` | Cell ops: `replace-source`, `insert`, `delete`, `move`, `clear-outputs` |
| `run-all` | Execute all cells |
| `restart` | Restart kernel |
| `restart-run-all` | Restart kernel + run all |
| `new` | Create notebook (auto-selects `.venv` kernel) |
| `kernels` | List available notebook kernels |
| `select-kernel` | Select kernel for a notebook |
| `prompts` | List prompt cells |
| `respond` | Answer a prompt cell |
| `reload` | Hot-reload extension routes |
| `v2` | Experimental core daemon commands: lifecycle plus attach/resume session, document, runtime, run, and file-sync ops |

All commands output JSON. Pass `--pretty` for formatted output.

## Installation

```bash
# Global CLI tool (recommended)
uv tool install /path/to/agent-repl

# Dev dependency in another project
uv add --dev agent-repl --path /path/to/agent-repl
```

The VS Code extension must also be installed. Build it with `cd extension && npm run compile && npx vsce package`, then install the `.vsix`.
For the packaged v2 auto-attach smoke check, run `cd extension && npm run test:artifact`.
Recompiling the repo alone does not update an already-installed extension under `~/.vscode/extensions/`; reinstall the `.vsix` after rebuilding, or run the repo in an Extension Development Host.
